From February 2021 I will be a MSc student in "Mathematical Modelling and Computing" at DTU, which will be a mix of Artificial Intelligence, Software Development and Financial Engineering. 

I already hold a MSc in "Sustainable Energy engineer" from DTU. During my MSc studies, I did an intership at the departement of Aereo and Hydrodynamics of FORCE Technology, a leading international company for engineering consultancy, and I helped them handling large datasets to perform data analyses on them to later develop a wind modelling approach for a case study.

During my free time, I enjoy coding a lot and I am constantly working on new projects to improve my back-end skills. Such as, following Machine Learning from Stanford or competing in a Kaggle challange. You can find some of them in the portfolio section.

Cheers,
Elena
